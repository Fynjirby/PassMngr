# PassMngr

Simple Cross-platform Pass Manager

Your can build your own PassMngr from source code using [pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/) for windows, [py2app](https://pypi.org/project/py2app/) for macOS and e.g. [py2deb](https://pypi.org/project/py2deb/) for debian-based linux. You can find other py to application converter on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) This all allowed because the main feature of my app is it's source code. Thanks for reading this readme.
