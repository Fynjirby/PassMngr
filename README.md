# PassMngr

Simple Cross-platform Pass Manager

Your can build your own PassMngr from source code using pyinstaller for windows, py2app for macOS and e.g. py2deb for debian-based linux. You can search other py to application converter. This all allowed because the main feature of my app is it's source code. Thanks for reading this readme.
